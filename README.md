## My process

I approached the QR code component challenge by breaking it down into several key steps:

1. **HTML Structure**: I started by creating the HTML structure for the project, including the necessary elements, such as the container, image, heading, and paragraphs.

2. **Styling with CSS**: I applied CSS styles to achieve the desired layout and design. This included setting up the container's dimensions, fonts, and alignment.

3. **Responsive Design**: I made sure the project was responsive by adjusting the styles and layout for different screen sizes. I used media queries to handle responsiveness.

4. **Optimizing Images**: I optimized the QR code image to improve loading times and overall performance.

5. **Final Touches**: I added any final touches, such as making sure the project looked great on various devices and adjusting any additional styling details.

The project was built using semantic HTML5 markup, CSS custom properties, and flexbox for layout. This process allowed me to complete the Results summary component solution component challenge successfully.

### Built with

- **HTML5:** The web page structure was created using semantic HTML.
- **CSS3:** Custom properties, Flexbox, and Grid were utilized for styling, resulting in a visually cohesive design.
- **Media Queries:** Ensured a responsive layout for various screen sizes.
- **Font Integration:** Incorporated fonts from Google Fonts for a unique typographic style.

### What I learned

- **Responsive Design Techniques:** Explored and implemented responsive design principles to create a seamless user experience on various devices.
- **CSS Custom Properties:** Leveraged CSS custom properties to maintain consistency and make design changes more manageable.
- **Gradient Usage:** Used gradients effectively to enhance the visual appeal of the components.

```css
/* Example CSS code you're proud of */
.circle {
  width: 40%;
  height: 30%;
  margin: auto;
  padding: 8%;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background: linear-gradient(
    to bottom,
    var(--violet-blue-circle),
    var(--persian-blue-circle)
  );
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to delve deeper into JavaScript to add interactive elements and explore more advanced styling techniques.
